                <p>All prices displayed on FlightFinder are in the currency indicated and include applicable taxes and fees unless otherwise stated. Additional fees may apply for certain payment methods, which will be clearly disclosed before completion of your booking.</p>
                
                <p>Payment processing is subject to the terms and conditions of our third-party payment processors. By making a payment through our platform, you agree to the terms of these payment processors.</p>
                
                <h3>3.2 Booking Confirmation</h3>

                <h3>3.3 Cancellations and Refunds</h3>
                <p>Cancellation and refund policies are determined by the airlines and travel providers, not by FlightFinder. These policies vary by provider, fare type, and other factors. Before making a booking, you should carefully review the specific terms related to your booking.</p>

                <p>FlightFinder charges a service fee for processing cancellations and refund requests, which is separate from any fees charged by airlines or travel providers. This fee will be clearly disclosed at the time of booking.</p>
